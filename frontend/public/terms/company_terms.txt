KU Work – Company Supplement to Core Terms of Use and Privacy Notice
Effective date: TBD

IMPORTANT: These Company Terms supplement the KU Work Core Terms of Use and Privacy Notice (/terms/ku_work_core_terms.txt). They add company‑specific obligations, data categories, and responsibilities (especially regarding candidate/student data). You must also accept the KU Work Privacy Policy (/terms/privacy_policy.txt). If there is a conflict, this Company Supplement governs for company‑specific activities, while the Core Terms govern generally.

----------------------------------------
1) Scope and Relationship
----------------------------------------
This Company Supplement covers:
- Company‑specific Terms of Use for access and use of KU Work (the “Service”) by authorized company representatives.
- Company‑specific Privacy details about processing of representative data and responsibilities when handling candidate (student) data.

Roles and responsibilities:
- KU (Kasetsart University) acts as a data controller for platform operations affecting company accounts.
- Your Company acts as an independent controller for any candidate personal data you export or process outside the platform (e.g., internal HR systems, external assessments).
- Where KU executes processing strictly according to documented, platform‑supported instructions (if such processor‑like features are added), KU acts as processor for those limited purposes; otherwise KU remains a controller.

----------------------------------------
2) Terms of Use (Company Supplement)
----------------------------------------
The Core Terms govern acceptable use, accounts, authentication, communications, security, and general obligations. Company‑specific additions:
2.1 Eligibility & Account Ownership
- Only authorized representatives of a legitimate company (accurate, verifiable details) may register and use a company account.
- You are responsible for credential confidentiality and actions under your account.

2.2 Enhanced Acceptable Use (Company Context)
In addition to Core Terms prohibitions, you agree not to:
- Post or advertise roles that are unlawful, deceptive, discriminatory, exploitative, or misrepresent compensation or required qualifications.
- Attempt scraping or bulk extraction of student data beyond legitimate job‑matching purposes.
- Use platform data for unsolicited marketing or unrelated profiling without a lawful basis and any required consents.

2.3 Company Content
- You remain responsible for accuracy and lawfulness of company profile, job postings, and related materials (logos, banners).
- You grant KU a limited, non‑exclusive license to store, display, and process submitted company content solely to operate, secure, improve, and moderate the Service.

2.4 Service Emails (Transactional)
- KU sends transactional/service emails (e.g., posting confirmations, application notifications). No marketing emails without separate lawful basis and consent where required.

2.5 AI‑Assisted Support
- KU may use AI to surface incomplete postings, potential policy violations, or quality improvements. Decisions with legal or similarly significant effects are not made solely by automated means without appropriate human review or required consents.

2.6 Changes
- Feature evolution may occur. Material changes to these Company Terms or privacy notices will trigger appropriate notice and, where required, renewed acceptance.

2.7 Suspension/Termination
- KU may suspend or terminate company access for violations creating legal, security, reputational, or compliance risks.

----------------------------------------
3) Privacy (Company Representatives – Supplement)
----------------------------------------
Supplementing the Core Privacy Notice:
3.1 Representative Data Categories (additions to Core)
- Company profile & administrative data: company name, address, website, representative name, role/title, contact details.
- Posting content: Job descriptions, criteria, metadata, media (logos/banners).
- Operational & security logs: limited necessary logs (timestamps, request identifiers, possibly IP addresses) for fraud prevention, security investigation, and stability.
- Communications: service notifications, application status messages (received or triggered), support requests.

3.2 Purposes & Legal Bases (Company Supplement)
In addition to Core purposes:
- Company account provisioning & role management (Contract necessity).
- Job posting publication & moderation (Contract necessity / Legitimate interests).
- Representative identification for compliance, audit, or dispute resolution (Legitimate interests / Legal obligation).
- Quality, integrity, and safety assessments (Legitimate interests).

3.3 No Behavioral Tracking
- KU does not perform behavioral tracking analytics for advertising or profiling of company representatives.

3.4 Sharing & Processors (Company Context)
- Hosting/infrastructure, email delivery, and optional moderation/AI tooling operate under data processing agreements with safeguards.
- Minimal exposure principle: only necessary data for each processor’s function.

3.5 International Transfers
- Safeguards (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses, PDPA‑compliant mechanisms) applied when data leaves Thailand or the EEA.

3.6 Retention
- Representative data retained while the company account is active and as needed for postings, legal compliance, or dispute resolution.
- Upon account closure or inactivity beyond defined grace periods, personal identifiers may be anonymized while retaining non‑identifiable aggregates.

3.7 Rights
- Access, rectification, erasure (subject to retention obligations), restriction, objection, portability (where applicable), withdrawal of consent (if consent used).
- Identity verification required for requests. Company is responsible for rights requests about candidate data processed outside KU Work.

3.8 Children & Sensitive Data
- Company accounts are for adult representatives; sensitive categories are not required. If you submit any sensitive data, you are responsible for legality and minimization.

3.9 Security
- Layered controls: authentication limits, token revocation, encryption in transit, least‑privilege access for support staff, integrity checks, anomaly monitoring.

3.10 Updates
- KU may update this Company Supplement; material changes prompt notice and possible re‑acceptance.

----------------------------------------
4) Candidate (Student) Data Handling by Your Company
----------------------------------------
4.1 Controller Responsibilities
- You must establish a lawful basis (e.g., contract necessity for application review, legitimate interests with balancing test, or consent where required) before processing candidate data.
- Implement suitable safeguards, minimize data, respect retention limits, and respond to rights requests promptly.

4.2 Exporting/Sharing Candidate Data
- Exports from the platform create independent controller obligations. Ensure secure channels, proper disclosure, and avoid repurposing for unrelated marketing or profiling without separate lawful basis and required consents.

4.3 Automated Decision‑Making / AI
- Any internal AI or automated review systems you deploy must comply with applicable laws (avoid solely automated adverse decisions without required conditions and human oversight).
- KU’s AI assistance remains bounded as described (support signals, not final determinations).
