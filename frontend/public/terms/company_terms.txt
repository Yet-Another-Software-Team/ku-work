KU Work – Company Terms of Use and Privacy Notice (Employers/Companies)
Effective date: TBD

IMPORTANT: By creating or using a company account on KU Work, you acknowledge that you have read and agree to these Company Terms of Use and Privacy Notice. Where the platform also presents “KU Work Terms,” you must review and accept those separately. These terms are designed with GDPR and Thailand’s PDPA compliance in mind.

----------------------------------------
1) Scope and Relationship
----------------------------------------
This document covers:
- The Terms of Use that apply to your company’s access and use of KU Work (the “Service”).
- The Privacy Notice describing how we process personal data of company representatives and how your use of the Service may involve the processing of candidate (student) personal data.

Roles and responsibilities:
- KU Work (the KU-operated parts of the platform) acts as a data controller for platform operations affecting your company user account and the platform’s general features.
- Your Company acts as an independent controller for personal data processing you undertake outside the platform (e.g., data you export, decisions you make about applicants, your own HR systems).
- Where KU processes personal data strictly according to your Company’s documented instructions within the platform (if any such processor-like feature is provided), KU will act as a processor for those limited purposes. Otherwise, KU remains a controller for the platform.

----------------------------------------
2) Terms of Use
----------------------------------------
2.1 Eligibility and Account Ownership
- Only authorized representatives of a legitimate company may register and use a company account.
- You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of credentials and for all actions taken using your account.

2.2 Acceptable Use
You agree not to:
- Violate any laws, regulations, or third-party rights, including labor, anti-discrimination, data protection, and intellectual property laws.
- Post misleading, unlawful, discriminatory, harassing, or infringing content.
- Attempt to gain unauthorized access to any data, accounts, or systems.
- Interfere with the security, integrity, or availability of the Service.
- Use the Service to send unsolicited commercial communications (spam).

2.3 Content Your Company Provides
- You are responsible for the accuracy and lawfulness of the company profile, job postings, and other content you submit.
- You grant KU a limited, non-exclusive license to store, display, and process such content to operate and improve the Service, including security and compliance.

2.4 Service Emails (Transactional)
- We use an email service to send transactional or service-related messages (e.g., account notices, job posting confirmations, application notifications). We do not send marketing emails without separate consent.

2.5 AI-Assisted Support
- We may use AI to assist with content quality checks, moderation, fraud prevention, or decision-support features (e.g., highlighting incomplete postings). Any decisions with legal or similarly significant effects are not made solely by automated means without appropriate human review or any additional consents required by law.

2.6 Changes to the Service
- Features may evolve over time. If changes materially affect these Terms or the Privacy Notice, we will provide appropriate notice and, where required, seek your consent.

2.7 Suspension/Termination
